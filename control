Description: RETS (Real Estate Transaction Standard) client library
 libRETS is RETS client library written in C++ that allows rapid development
 of RETS client applications. By saving the developer from dealing with the
 RETS protocol details, the application writer can concentrate on their
 application, saving them time and money in the process. It is released under
 a BSD-style license.
