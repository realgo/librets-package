Debian Packages for libRETS
===========================

This is a set of Debian packaging files for libRETS
( https://github.com/NationalAssociationOfRealtors/libRETS/releases ).
Using these and the libRETS source, you should be able to build
"librets1" and "librets-dev" packages.

This has been developed on Ubuntu 14.04, and should work on any recent
Ubuntu or Debian release.

Building
--------

WARNING: Once Debian Testing updates from Python 3.10 to something newer,
this will no longer work.

The upstream has some issues with building under Ubuntu 22.04.  To build
for 22.04:

- Clone https://github.com/linsomniac/libRETS
- Run "docker build -t librets ."
- Run: "docker run -v /tmp/deb:/tmp/deb -it librets:latest /bin/bash"
- Run: "cp *.deb /tmp/deb"
- Run: "exit"

The packages should now be in "/tmp/deb" on your system.

Building (Legacy)
-----------------

NOTE: This asumes the 1.6.5 version.  If you are building a different version,
Change the version number in the commands below and **ALSO** change
"debian/changelog" where it says "1.6.5" to the version you are building.

Steps to build deb files:

- Download the libRETS tar file from the above URL

```bash
wget https://github.com/NationalAssociationOfRealtors/libRETS/archive/1.6.5.tar.gz
```

- Rename into Debian-compatible format

```bash
mv 1.6.5.tar.gz librets_1.6.5.orig.tar.gz
```

- Extract tar file

```bash
tar xf librets_1.6.5.orig.tar.gz
```

- Clone this repository to "debian" sub-directory

```bash
cd libRETS-1.6.5
git clone https://github.com/realgo/librets-package debian
```

- Run "debuild".
- Deb files should be in parent directory.

Sample run:

```bash
wget https://github.com/NationalAssociationOfRealtors/libRETS/archive/1.6.5.tar.gz
mv 1.6.5.tar.gz librets_1.6.5.orig.tar.gz
tar xf librets_1.6.5.orig.tar.gz
cd libRETS-1.6.5
git clone https://github.com/realgo/librets-package debian
debuild
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

Docker
------

You can build the Debian package within an Ubuntu container and a Ubuntu
container with the deb packages installed:

```docker build -t ubuntu-librets:1.6.5 .```

You can now use "ubuntu-librets" as a docker image with librets packages
installed.  You can also run the container to copy off the deb files from the
container:

```docker run --name librets-packages ubuntu-librets:1.6.5
docker cp librets-packages:build/librets1_1.6.5-1realgo1_amd64.deb .
docker cp librets-packages:build/librets-dev_1.6.5-1realgo1_amd64.deb .
docker kill librets-packages```
